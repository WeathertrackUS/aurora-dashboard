Changelog - 2025.02.02

WTUS SpaceWx Dashboard Official Release v1.0

The SpaceWx has finally been taken out of BETA for an official full release!

Here's the changelog with today's update:

MAJOR UPDATES

- Moved the 'Active Solar Regions' to the right side of the 'Overview' tab on the 'Solar Activity' page.
This will allow for more "at-a-glance" viewing of the webpage for desktop/laptop users. The layout is mostly unchanged on mobile, although, more details have been added with each region in the list, featuring the 'Area', measured in MSH.

- Fixed a bug where the zoomed-in views of the regions in the modal boxes for each region. Previously, the regions would be very off-center, or cut out of the image. This is fixed for now, but long-term testing will have to prove the effectiveness of the fix. Further changes may be needed.

- Changed plot/chart providers (Check Minor Updates for more).

MINOR UPDATES

- Fixed a bug with the timestamps at the top right of the pages.

- Added a sorting function on the 'Region Flare Activity' list. This will allow users to sort by class (intensity), time, duration, or the flare(s) that have been connected by a CME.

- Added new functionality with the X-Ray Flux Chart. Now looking much cleaner, and readouts are way more readable! Flares are now marked with points on the graph. There's also a time slider that'll allow users to zoom into specific timeframes on the graph.

- Improved Geomagnetic Charts. Data now loads faster, and more reliable. Dst chart now has a gradient (but has some ongoing bugs that should be fixed soon).

While the site is now out of beta, and is now in a full public release, some bugs may still be present and occur. Please report these bugs, and we'll do our best to fix them.
Feature requests are much appreciated, and of course, we'll be adding way more to the site in the coming weeks, months, and hopefully years!
